In this paper, we introduce a new layer normalization technique\\ncalled Dynamic Layer Normalization (DLN) for adaptive neural acoustic modeling\\nin speech recognition. By dynamically generating the scaling and shifting\\nparameters in layer normalization, DLN adapts neural acoustic models to the\\nacoustic variability arising from various factors such as speakers, channel\\nnoises, and environments. Unlike other adaptive acoustic models, our proposed\\napproach does not require additional adaptation data or speaker information\\nsuch as i-vectors. Moreover, the model size is fixed as it dynamically\\ngenerates adaptation parameters. We apply our proposed DLN to deep\\nbidirectional LSTM acoustic models and evaluate them on two benchmark datasets\\nfor large vocabulary ASR experiments: WSJ and TED-LIUM release 2. The\\nexperimental results show that our DLN improves neural acoustic models in terms\\nof transcription accuracy by dynamically adapting to various speakers and\\nenvironments.\\n\",\n          \"  A susceptibility propagation that is constructed by combining a belief\\npropagation and a linear response method is used for approximate computation\\nfor Markov random fields. Herein, we formulate a new, improved susceptibility\\npropagation by using the concept of a diagonal matching method that is based on\\nmean-field approaches to inverse Ising problems. The proposed susceptibility\\npropagation is robust for various network structures, and it is reduced to the\\nordinary susceptibility propagation and to the adaptive\\nThouless-Anderson-Palmer equation in special cases.\\n\",\n          \"  We propose a new model for formalizing reward collection problems on graphs\\nwith dynamically generated rewards which may appear and disappear based on a\\nstochastic model. The *robot routing problem* is modeled as a graph whose nodes\\nare stochastic processes generating potential rewards over discrete time. The\\nrewards are generated according to the stochastic process, but at each step, an\\nexisting reward disappears with a given probability. The edges in the graph\\nencode the (unit-distance) paths between the rewards' locations. On visiting a\\nnode, the robot collects the accumulated reward at the node at that time, but\\ntraveling between the nodes takes time. The optimization question asks to\\ncompute an optimal (or epsilon-optimal) path that maximizes the expected\\ncollected rewards.\\nWe consider the finite and infinite-horizon robot routing problems. For\\nfinite-horizon, the goal is to maximize the total expected reward, while for\\ninfinite horizon we consider limit-average objectives. We study the\\ncomputational and strategy complexity of these problems, establish NP-lower\\nbounds and show that optimal strategies require memory in general. We also\\nprovide an algorithm for computing epsilon-optimal infinite paths for arbitrary\\nepsilon > 0.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Computer Science\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Physics\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Mathematics\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Statistics\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Quantitative Biology\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Quantitative Finance\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

In this paper, we introduce a new layer normalization technique\\ncalled Dynamic Layer Normalization (DLN) for adaptive neural acoustic modeling\\nin speech recognition. By dynamically generating the scaling and shifting\\nparameters in layer normalization, DLN adapts neural acoustic models to the\\nacoustic variability arising from various factors such as speakers, channel\\nnoises, and environments. Unlike other adaptive acoustic models, our proposed\\napproach does not require additional adaptation data or speaker information\\nsuch as i-vectors. Moreover, the model size is fixed as it dynamically\\ngenerates adaptation parameters. We apply our proposed DLN to deep\\nbidirectional LSTM acoustic models and evaluate them on two benchmark datasets\\nfor large vocabulary ASR experiments: WSJ and TED-LIUM release 2. The\\nexperimental results show that our DLN improves neural acoustic models in terms\\nof transcription accuracy by dynamically adapting to various speakers and\\nenvironments.\\n\",\n          \"Susceptibility Propagation by Using Diagonal Consistency  A susceptibility propagation that is constructed by combining a belief\\npropagation and a linear response method is used for approximate computation\\nfor Markov random fields. Herein, we formulate a new, improved susceptibility\\npropagation by using the concept of a diagonal matching method that is based on\\nmean-field approaches to inverse Ising problems. The proposed susceptibility\\npropagation is robust for various network structures, and it is reduced to the\\nordinary susceptibility propagation and to the adaptive\\nThouless-Anderson-Palmer equation in special cases.\\n\",\n          \"The Robot Routing Problem for Collecting Aggregate Stochastic Rewards  We propose a new model for formalizing reward collection problems on graphs\\nwith dynamically generated rewards which may appear and disappear based on a\\nstochastic model. The *robot routing problem* is modeled as a graph whose nodes\\nare stochastic processes generating potential rewards over discrete time. The\\nrewards are generated according to the stochastic process, but at each step, an\\nexisting reward disappears with a given probability. The edges in the graph\\nencode the (unit-distance) paths between the rewards' locations. On visiting a\\nnode, the robot collects the accumulated reward at the node at that time, but\\ntraveling between the nodes takes time. The optimization question asks to\\ncompute an optimal (or epsilon-optimal) path that maximizes the expected\\ncollected rewards.\\nWe consider the finite and infinite-horizon robot routing problems. For\\nfinite-horizon, the goal is to maximize the total expected reward, while for\\ninfinite horizon we consider limit-average objectives. We study the\\ncomputational and strategy complexity of these problems, establish NP-lower\\nbounds and show that optimal strategies require memory in general. We also\\nprovide an algorithm for computing epsilon-optimal infinite paths for arbitrary\\nepsilon > 0.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Computer Science\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Physics\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Mathematics\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Statistics\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Quantitative Biology\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Quantitative Finance\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The rainbow functions will be motivated from\\nresults in loop quantum gravity and Noncommutative geometry. It will be\\nobserved that the thermodynamics gets deformed due to these rainbow functions,\\nindicating the existence of a remnant. However, the Gibbs free energy does not\\nget deformed due to these rainbow functions, and so the critical behaviour from\\nGibbs does not change by this deformation.This is because the deformation in\\nthe entropy cancel's out the temperature deformation.\\n\",\n          \"Transport signatures of topological superconductivity in a proximity-coupled nanowire  We study the conductance of a junction between the normal and superconducting\\nsegments of a nanowire, both of which are subjected to spin-orbit coupling and\\nan external magnetic field. We directly compare the transport properties of the\\nnanowire assuming two different models for the superconducting segment: one\\nwhere we put superconductivity by hand into the wire, and one where\\nsuperconductivity is induced through a tunneling junction with a bulk s-wave\\nsuperconductor. While these two models are equivalent at low energies and at\\nweak coupling between the nanowire and the superconductor, we show that there\\nare several interesting qualitative differences away from these two limits. In\\nparticular, the tunneling model introduces an additional conductance peak at\\nthe energy corresponding to the bulk gap of the parent superconductor. By\\nemploying a combination of analytical methods at zero temperature and numerical\\nmethods at finite temperature, we show that the tunneling model of the\\nproximity effect reproduces many more of the qualitative features that are seen\\nexperimentally in such a nanowire system.\\n\",\n          \"Optimization Methods for Supervised Machine Learning: From Linear Models to Deep Learning  The goal of this tutorial is to introduce key models, algorithms, and open\\nquestions related to the use of optimization methods for solving problems\\narising in machine learning. It is written with an INFORMS audience in mind,\\nspecifically those readers who are familiar with the basics of optimization\\nalgorithms, but less familiar with machine learning. We begin by deriving a\\nformulation of a supervised learning problem and show how it leads to various\\noptimization problems, depending on the context and underlying assumptions. We\\nthen discuss some of the distinctive features of these optimization problems,\\nfocusing on the examples of logistic regression and the training of deep neural\\nnetworks. The latter half of the tutorial focuses on optimization algorithms,\\nfirst for convex logistic regression, for which we discuss the use of\\nfirst-order methods, the stochastic gradient method, variance reducing\\nstochastic methods, and second-order methods. Finally, we discuss how these\\napproaches can be employed to the training of deep neural networks, emphasizing\\nthe difficulties that arise from the complex, nonconvex structure of these\\nmodels.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Computer Science\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Physics\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Mathematics\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Statistics\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Quantitative Biology\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Quantitative Finance\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
